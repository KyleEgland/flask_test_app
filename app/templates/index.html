<h1>This is an example Flask App!</h1>
<p>
    Congratulations, the app is running!  From here, do what you like - the app is yours to consume.  Remember, the navigation bar up top doesn't work, it's just there for demonstration purposes.  If you'd like to "hook-it-up", you can do so in the "base.html" file, located in the "templates" directory.
